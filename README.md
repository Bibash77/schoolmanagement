# School Management Project

## Overview
The School Management Project is a Demo project for microservice architecture

##
Some action may not make sense but its there to make implementation simple.  Gateway hasnt been added since its not much necessary for now . 
## Services

### 1. Config Service
- This service is responsible for storing and providing configuration-related information for the other services in the project.
- It is protected by the following credentials:
  - `spring.cloud.config.username=root`
  - `spring.cloud.config.password=s3cr3t`

### 2. Discovery Service
- This service uses **Eureka** for service registration and discovery.
- It allows all other services to register themselves and be discoverable by other parts of the system.

### 3. User Management Service
- **Admin User:**
  - A default admin user is created with the following credentials:
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `admin`
- **Student Management:**
  - Students can self-register using the exposed API.
- **Teacher Management:**
  - Teachers are managed by the admin user.

- **Redis Storage:**
  - All user-related data, including students and teachers, is stored in **Cache** while fetc. It uses **Redis Cache** by default.
  
- **Kafka Integration:**
  - When a new student or teacher is created, a Kafka message is triggered. Only a simple string serializer is used for message passing.
    
- **Postgresql Integration:**
  - Single database has been integrated.
  -  dbName: school_management , username: postgres , pw: postgres
- **Postman Integration:**
  - Json collection is in resource folder.

### 4. Notification Service
- This service consumes notifications produced by the **User Management Service**.
- Notifications can be used for various purposes, such as informing users about system events or updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized configuration management.
- **Spring Eureka** for service discovery.
- **Redis** for caching user data.
- **Kafka** for message passing.
- **Spring Boot** for microservices.

## Configuration Details
- Configuration data (e.g., database credentials, service settings) is retrieved from the Config Service.
- The `User Management Service` interacts with Kafka for communication between services.
- Redis is used for caching user data (both students and teachers).

## Running the Project
1. Start the **Config Service** with configuration settings.
2. Start the **Discovery Service** to allow services to register and discover each other.
3. Start the **User Management Service** for managing users (students and teachers).
4. Start the **Notification Service** to receive notifications generated by the User Management Service.

## Security
- The Config Service is secured with a username and password.
- Default username : admin and password : admin for admin-user : 

## Conclusion
This project offers a basic framework for managing a school system, including user management (admin, teachers, and students), configuration handling, service discovery, and notifications.
